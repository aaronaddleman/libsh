# what directories do you want to seach for by name?
# this makes for having to just type the directory

# define a git template that you want to use for your
# commit messages
# export ENABLE_GIT_COMMIT_TEMPLATE=$HOME/src/dotfiles/git/commit-msg-template

# GoEnv
#
# This allows you to select versions of GoLangs installed
# on your system. Some people like this and its best to
# let the tool take over setting paths. To stop this,
# comment out the following line:
export LIBSH_GOENV_MGMT_PATH=true

# LibSh    #
# Settings #

# enable debuging to a file of $LIBSH_HOME/debug.log
# export LIBSH_DEBUG=t

# Select functions to load
#
# choose which functions to load
#
# there are two files inside of libsh for each
# function that split up the function and the environment
#
# filename.sh       = functions
# filename.env.sh   = variables (paths, etc...)
#
# the reason for this is to follow best practice
# of loading the functions being separate from
# the environment variables
#
# if configured correctly, bash or zsh will load the
# filename.env.sh first, then proceed to load the
# filename.sh second
