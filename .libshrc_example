# Variables used by LIBSH

# enable debuging to a file of $LIBSH_HOME/debug.log
# export LIBSH_DEBUG=t

# define your parent directory of all code
# this is used by the "git_clone" function to
# organize your repos by $domain/$org/$project
# export LIBSH_SRC_DIR=$HOME/src

# should we try to login with vault_login?
# export LIBSH_USE_VAULT_LOGIN=t

# rvm can be bloated sometimes
# to disable per env, set or unset
# export LIBSH_ENABLE_RVM=t

# what directories do you want to seach for by name?
# this makes for having to just type the directory
# into the shell prompt and it will find the first match
# export LIBSH_CDPATH=$HOME/src:$HOME/github.com:$HOME/company.com

# define a git template that you want to use for your
# commit messages
# export ENABLE_GIT_COMMIT_TEMPLATE=$HOME/src/dotfiles/git/commit-msg-template


# Select functions to load
#
# choose which functions to load
#
# there are two files inside of libsh for each
# function that split up the function and the environment
#
# filename.sh       = functions
# filename.env.sh   = variables (paths, etc...)
#
# the reason for this is to follow best practice
# of loading the functions being separate from
# the environment variables
#
# if configured correctly, bash or zsh will load the
# filename.env.sh first, then proceed to load the
# filename.sh second
